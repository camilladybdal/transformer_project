# transformer_project

This repository contains my final project in the class Machine Learning at the University of Bologna, 2021-2022. 

The target of this project has been to train a Transformer model on an English to Russian dataset, as well as a dataset consisting of questions and answers.
The results are discussed in the report. 

My code is based off the tensorflow tutorial [found here](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer), which covers the Transformer model.
